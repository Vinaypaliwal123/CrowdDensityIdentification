Hello, I'm Vinay Paliwal, and I've developed a unique and efficient solution for estimating crowd density using machine learning. This project leverages the power of TensorFlow and EfficientDet, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to identify and count people in images.

The code is designed to be simple and easy to understand, yet powerful in its capabilities. It includes detailed comments explaining each step, making it a great resource for anyone interested in machine learning or crowd density estimation.

One of the key features of this project is the generation of a heatmap, which provides a visual representation of crowd density. This can be particularly useful for monitoring public spaces, planning events, or any scenario where understanding crowd density is important.

Also, I'm open to contributions! If you have any ideas for improvements or enhancements, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Let's work together to make this project even better!

# Crowd Density Estimation

This is a crowd density estimation system using an object detection model. 

## Code

```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore") 
import cv2
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

model_url = "https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/efficientdet/d7/1"
model = hub.load(model_url)

image_path = "img2.jpeg"
image = cv2.imread(image_path)
image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

input_image = tf.convert_to_tensor(image, dtype=tf.uint8)
input_image = tf.expand_dims(input_image, axis=0)

predictions = model(input_image)
result = {key: value[0].numpy() for key, value in predictions.items()}

num_detections = int(result["num_detections"])
NoOfPeople = 0
heatmap = np.zeros_like(image[:, :, 0], dtype=np.float32)

for i in range(num_detections):
    box = result["detection_boxes"][i]
    class_id = int(result["detection_classes"][i])
    score = result["detection_scores"][i]

    if class_id == 1 and score > 0.5:
        ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax = box
        xmin = int(xmin * image.shape[1])
        xmax = int(xmax * image.shape[1])
        ymin = int(ymin * image.shape[0])
        ymax = int(ymax * image.shape[0])

        cv2.rectangle(image, (xmin, ymin), (xmax, ymax), (255, 0, 0), 2)
        NoOfPeople += 1
        heatmap[ymin:ymax, xmin:xmax] += 1

heatmap = heatmap / heatmap.max()

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

area = float(input("Enter the area of the place in m^2"))
crowd_density = NoOfPeople/area;

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.imshow(image)
plt.title(f"NoOfPeople: {NoOfPeople}, Crowd_density: {crowd_density} p/m^2")
plt.axis("off")

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.heatmap(heatmap, cmap="hot", cbar_kws={'label': 'Crowd Density'})
plt.title('Crowd Density Heatmap')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Explanation

The code begins by importing necessary Python libraries such as `warnings`, `cv2`, `numpy`, `tensorflow`, `tensorflow_hub`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

The code then loads a pre-trained EfficientDet model from TensorFlow Hub using the specified URL.

The code reads an image, converts its color from BGR to RGB, and then converts it to a tensor of type `tf.uint8`. The image tensor is then expanded along the 0th dimension to match the input shape expected by the model.

The model is used to make predictions on the input image. The predictions are then post-processed to extract the number of detections and initialize a heatmap of zeros with the same shape as the input image.

For each detection, if the detected object is a person (class ID 1) and the detection score is greater than 0.5, a rectangle is drawn around the detected person in the image, the number of people is incremented, and the corresponding region in the heatmap is updated.

The heatmap is normalized by dividing it by its maximum value.

The area of the place is taken as input from the user, and the crowd density is calculated as the number of people detected divided by the area.

Finally, the code displays the original image with bounding boxes drawn around detected people and the corresponding crowd density, along with a heatmap showing the crowd density.
