Greetings, I'm Vinay Paliwal. I've architected a distinctive and effective method for analyzing crowd density using machine learning. This project employs TensorFlow and EfficientDet, an advanced object detection model, to discern and tally individuals in images.

The code is constructed to be uncomplicated and intelligible, yet potent in its execution. It encompasses comprehensive commentary elucidating each step, making it an excellent guide for those intrigued by machine learning or crowd density analysis.

A significant attribute of this project is the generation of a heatmap, which offers a visual illustration of crowd density. This can be especially beneficial for supervising public spaces, orchestrating events, or any situation where comprehending crowd density is crucial.

I encourage you to delve into the code, experiment with your own images, and observe the results firsthand. If you find it advantageous, please consider starring the repository and sharing it with others who might be interested. Your support is greatly valued!

Also, I welcome contributions! If you have any suggestions for improvements or enhancements, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Let's collaborate to enhance this project!

# Estimating Crowd Density

This is a system for estimating crowd density using an object detection model.

## Code

```python
# Code here
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore") 
import cv2
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

model_url = "https://www.kaggle.com/models/tensorflow/efficientdet/frameworks/TensorFlow2/variations/d7/versions/1"
model = hub.load(model_url)

image_path = "img2.jpeg"
image = cv2.imread(image_path)
image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

input_image = tf.convert_to_tensor(image, dtype=tf.uint8)
input_image = tf.expand_dims(input_image, axis=0)

predictions = model(input_image)
result = {key: value[0].numpy() for key, value in predictions.items()}

num_detections = int(result["num_detections"])
NoOfPeople = 0
heatmap = np.zeros_like(image[:, :, 0], dtype=np.float32)

for i in range(num_detections):
    box = result["detection_boxes"][i]
    class_id = int(result["detection_classes"][i])
    score = result["detection_scores"][i]

    if class_id == 1 and score > 0.5:
        ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax = box
        xmin = int(xmin * image.shape[1])
        xmax = int(xmax * image.shape[1])
        ymin = int(ymin * image.shape[0])
        ymax = int(ymax * image.shape[0])

        cv2.rectangle(image, (xmin, ymin), (xmax, ymax), (255, 0, 0), 2)
        NoOfPeople += 1
        heatmap[ymin:ymax, xmin:xmax] += 1

heatmap = heatmap / heatmap.max()

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

area = float(input("Enter the area of the place in m^2"))
crowd_density = NoOfPeople/area;

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.imshow(image)
plt.title(f"NoOfPeople: {NoOfPeople}, Crowd_density: {crowd_density} p/m^2")
plt.axis("off")

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.heatmap(heatmap, cmap="hot", cbar_kws={'label': 'Crowd Density'})
plt.title('Crowd Density Heatmap')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Explanation

The code commences by importing necessary Python libraries such as `warnings`, `cv2`, `numpy`, `tensorflow`, `tensorflow_hub`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

Next, the code loads a pre-trained EfficientDet model from TensorFlow Hub using the specified URL.

The code reads an image, alters its color from BGR to RGB, and then converts it to a tensor of type `tf.uint8`. The image tensor is then expanded along the 0th dimension to match the input shape expected by the model.

The model is used to make predictions on the input image. The predictions are then post-processed to extract the number of detections and initialize a heatmap of zeros with the same shape as the input image.

For each detection, if the detected object is a person (class ID 1) and the detection score is greater than 0.5, a rectangle is drawn around the detected person in the image, the number of people is incremented, and the corresponding region in the heatmap is updated.

The heatmap is normalized by dividing it by its maximum value.

The area of the place is taken as input from the user, and the crowd density is calculated as the number of people detected divided by the area.

Finally, the code displays the original image with bounding boxes drawn around detected people and the corresponding crowd density, along with a heatmap showing the crowd density.
